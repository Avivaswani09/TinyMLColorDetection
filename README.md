In the ever-evolving landscape of agriculture and food processing, this report introduces a 
groundbreaking application of TinyML, emphasizing the transformative potential of a color detection 
system. Our innovative approach centers around the real-time detection of fruit and vegetable ripeness, 
particularly in the manufacturing of ketchup, showcasing the profound impact of TinyML in addressing 
challenges within the agriculture and food processing sectors. By harnessing the inherent cost- 
effectiveness, practicality, and scalability of TinyML, our implementation offers a solution that is both 
efficient and scalable, with a unique focus on precision color detection.
